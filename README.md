[00:05.64] No
[00:08.13] Ah, na na na na na
[00:17.13] 
[00:10.77] Since you were a boy, you took the weight of the world
[00:16.21] And held onto it 'til you fell to the ground
[00:20.06] Like you had no choice, you did it for your little girl
[00:25.38] So she would never feel the way you do now
[00:46.38] 
[00:29.13] I know it gets (so hard, so hard)
[00:32.89] And it always seems to go on (and on, and on)
[00:37.06] But it's okay
[00:43.56] 
[00:38.26] Please don't beat yourself up, oh, whatever you do
[00:42.71] 'Cause it doesn't do nothin', but just break you in two
[00:47.48] Please don't beat yourself up, though you made some mistakes
[00:51.97] But you know it means somethin' when you'll live one more day
[01:22.47] 
[00:56.59] When you're 17 (17), and you're feelin' so bold, ah
[01:01.81] And realize you gotta do what you're told
[01:05.70] Now you're 23, and you're only worth what you sold
[01:10.52] But my mother said, "Some things are worth more than gold"
[01:39.52] 
[01:14.90] I feel it now (so hard, so hard)
[01:18.46] And it always seems to go on (and on, and on)
[01:21.43] On and on, but it's okay
[01:33.43] 
[01:24.03] Please don't beat yourself up, oh, whatever you do (whatever you do)
[01:28.65] 'Cause that doesn't do nothin', bbut just break you in two
[01:32.90] Please don't beat yourself up (up), though you made some mistakes (yeah)
[01:37.71] But you know it means somethin' when you'll live one more day (day)
[02:11.21] 
[01:42.74] Ooh, ooh
[01:45.10] Ooh, ooh (ah)
[01:47.44] Ooh, ooh
[01:49.62] Ooh, ooh
[01:53.62] 
[01:51.17] You gotta feel the joy and laugh 'til it hurts
[01:56.91] And thank God every day you're still on this earth
[02:00.63] If you got a voice (got a voice)
[02:02.92] It belongs in this world, so
[02:05.83] Hear me out (hear me out)
[02:07.01] Hear me out (hear me out)
[02:07.84] How do you feel now?
[02:17.84] 
[02:09.68] Please don't beat yourself up, oh, whatever you do
[02:14.20] 'Cause that doesn't do nothin', but just break you in two
[02:18.89] Please don't beat yourself up (up), though you made some mistakes
[02:23.49] But you know it means somethin' when you'll live one more day (live one more day)
[03:03.99] 
[02:27.96] Please don't beat yourself up, oh, whatever you do (whatever you do, ooh)
[02:32.54] 'Cause it doesn't do nothin', but just break you in two (break you in two)
[02:37.20] Please don't beat yourself up, though you made some mistakes (made some mistakes)
[02:41.74] But you know it means somethin' when you'll live one more day (live one more day)
[03:22.24] 
[02:49.41] Ah, yeah, ah-na-na, no, no
[02:53.29] When you'll live one more day
